summary: A trip I took to Heihe, followed by a ferry to Blagoveshchensk
---

Playing around further on Google Maps finding my next trip to northern China, I came across Heihe (黑河市), which I knew I must visit since it is bordering with the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk (Благовещенск), separated by the Amur river. I love borders, and this one seemed especially interesting because it's a ferry crossing. But what I found even more interesting is the two cities are separated by a distance shorter than Central & TST across Victoria Harbour in my home of Hong Kong, which itself is just a 10 minute ride on the Star Ferry!

## Preparation & getting there

As an Indian citizen, visiting Russia is not too hard; I could just apply for an [E-Visa online](https://evisa.kdmid.ru/), and Blagoveshchensk was one of the valid cross points where it was accepted. I've visitied China numerous times, and I've got all the apps and stuff needed to get around (Weixin, Alipay, Didi etc.). However I'd never been to Russia, and thanks to the current sanctions there didn't seem to be an easy way to book accomodation. Furthermore there was almost no information about the ferry available, so I ultimately decided to settle for a day-trip to Russia (rather than spending a night).

I think this decision was locked in when I applied for the visa, as they ask when you plan to enter/exit, and where you'll be staying - I specifically mentioned I'll just do a day trip while staying in Heihe. I didn't have super high hopes since even I thought it already sounded dodgy, and in the worst case I'd just visit Heihe and look across the river at Russia. To my surprise though, when I checked a few days later, the visa was approved! I still had no idea about the ferry and how I'd buy some rubles (since none of my cards would work), but I decided to worry about that once I reached Heihe.

Getting to Heihe itself was non-trivial; during my previous trip to Northern China, I'd done it all on their high-speed rail network. However Heihe was only connected by slower trains, and I'd need to get to Harbin first, which from Hong Kong is already a bit of a hassle. However, there was one cheat code I could use: Go to Shenzhen first, and then take a domestic flight. Luckily, there was a "direct" flight from Shenzhen to Heihe (with an hour long stop in Harbin), which was super convenient.

The timings worked perfectly for my days off; though the early morning flight on Friday and late arrival on Monday meant I'd need to spend those nights near SZX, and do the HKG/SZX train journeys on Thursday evening & Tuesday morning respectively. This still worked out better (and cheaper) than trying to fly from HKG to HEK.

## Heihe

Heihe is a fairly small town as far as places I've visited go, and definitely the smallest airport I've ever been to. Just a single runway connected to a "terminal", the plane had to make a U-turn after landing and taxi back via the runway, which was a first. We just walked down the stairs, onto the tarmac and towards the terminal, which was basically just a waiting area and baggage carousell. (Departures had some basic security though,  of course).

Walking outside the terminal, it was already extremely pretty. I was visiting in mid-October, and the trees were all shades of orange & red, and the kind you'd find in a more temperate climate, which was a nice change from Hong Kong.

Checking in to the hotel was a bit of a fun ordeal. Being on the border with Russia, I think hotels have to take some extra precautionary steps about who's checking in and verifying their documents. At the time I was travelling on a multiple entry tourist visa, which is type "L". However, the "entries" section said "M" for multiple, which the check-in staff thought meant it was a type "M" visa - for commercial / business purposes. Furthermore, for Russian tourists, the hotel staff keep the passports for the entire duration of their stay, which is what they wanted to do with mine!

I'm guessing this rule is something to do with onward travel if they're coming to China on some visa-waiver or something, but I can't be sure. Thankfully, there was a Russian family also checking-in, and they helped me with a game of telephone as I was checking in to explain my visa situation.

* I spoke in English to the mum in the family
* She spoke in Russian to her tour guide
* The tour guide spoke in Mandarin to the hotel staff
* The staff replied to the tour guide in Mandarin
* The tour guide then translated that to Russian and told the mum
* Finally, the mum translated it to me in English

I'm sure some stuff got lost in the process, but I was able to explain that I would go to Russia the next day so I needed my passport. They finally agreed to give it back to me "after 15 minutes" and told me to go to my room and get settled in first. Not sure what happened in those 15 minutes, but I'm sure my passport is already leaked from the various hotels I've checked in other Chinese cities where the staff just take a photo with their personal phone. Oh well.
