title: "Moving away from Cloudflare Protection"

summary: I've stopped using Cloudflare's Protection (Proxy Mode) for my websites, partly to avoid centralization of the internet, and partly because of their user-hostile behavior

## Disclaimer

I still use a lot of other cloudflare products, such as R2 for object storage and DNS for my domains. They have built a great suite of products and rival AWS & GCP in several offerings, often with better pricing. This little post is specifically about their "proxy" mode for DDoS (and other) protection though.

## What is CF's proxy mode?

When configure your DNS in cloudflare, there is a very tempting toggle, even on the free plan: "Proxy Mode". This is on by default when adding a new DNS record (well, if it's `A/AAAA/CNAME`). Cloudflare prominently lists the benfits of this, including:

* Protect your origin server from DDoS attacks
* Optimize, cache, and protect all requests to your application.
* Hiding the IP address of your actual server

To be clear, all of these are true. But are they necessary? At what cost?

## How it works
