#### About

I'm a Computer Science student who loves server side technologies, encryption and privacy. I enjoy networking (the TCP/IP kind) and writing low level code to do the same. 

[Peerview](https://peerview.saxrag.com) is an example of a program I wrote in C/C++ which uses UDP sockets to find IPs downloading a torrent.

[Bacryptup](https://bacryptup.saxrag.com/) is an end-to-end encrypted filesharing service I developed. The server never knows the file contents, and it offers a secure way share sensitive data. You can read more about it [here](/bacryptup)

### Hire Me!

I have ~2 years of experience working with startups as a backend developer, designing RESTful APIs and working with both Mongo & SQL. I'm also great with cloud infrastructure, handling deployments (AWS - EC2, S3 etc.) and proper Git usage. 
In fact all my projects are hosted on my own servers, where I manage deployments, reverse proxies, DNS / TLS and the like. 

I also like working with media streaming and DRM, analyzing network protocols, playing with Wireshark and advocating for privacy. I especially dislike censorship on the internet.

If you're interested in hiring me, shoot me an email and we can discuss more.
